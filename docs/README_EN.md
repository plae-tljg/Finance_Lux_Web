## 🗄️ Database Schema

The application uses SQL.js to create and manage the following tables:

- **categories**: Transaction categories (income/expense types)
- **budgets**: Monthly budget allocations by category
- **transactions**: Individual income and expense records
- **bank_balances**: Monthly bank balance tracking

## 🔧 Database Debugger

The application includes a built-in database debugger component (`DatabaseDebugger`) that provides:

- Real-time database status monitoring
- Data overview and statistics
- Detailed table views
- Data export functionality (JSON format)
- Database testing and reset capabilities
- Operation logging

Access it by including the `DatabaseDebugger` component in your app.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **React 19** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **SQL.js** - Client-side SQLite database
- **ESLint** - Code linting

## 🚢 Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment

The project includes a deployment script for GitHub Pages:

```bash
./deploy-gh-pages.sh
```

The script will:
1. Build the project with the correct base path
2. Create/update the `gh-pages` branch
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Note**: Make sure you're on the `main` or `master` branch and have committed all changes before running the deployment script.

After deployment:
1. Go to your GitHub repository Settings → Pages
2. Select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose the `gh-pages` branch
4. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/Finance-Management-Web`

## 🎯 Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Database Changes**: Update schemas in `src/services/database/schemas/`
2. **Data Access**: Create or update repositories in `src/services/database/repositories/`
3. **UI Components**: Add components in `src/components/`
4. **Business Logic**: Add services in `src/services/`

### Database Initialization

The database is automatically initialized when the app loads using the `useDatabaseSetup` hook. It:
- Creates all necessary tables
- Sets up indexes for performance
- Inserts default categories if the database is new
